Internship at CERN\[cq]s Data Preservation and Open Access
project (http://opendata.cern.ch), focused on the new CMS open data

associated data provenance generator fragments.
With this information, each dataset can be categorised into hierarchical
topic categories, based on the Physics behind that process.
I also worked in improving various parts of the portal such as
documentation, glossary, and the user interface.
The work was carried out essentially in the Python programming language
using the Flask micro web development framework and the Jinja templating
language.

Search Strategies and Phase Transition in the Random Boolean
Satisfiability Problem
.PP
The Boolean Satisfiability Problem is the problem of deciding if a given
Boolean formula, such as (x1 \[OR] x2 \[OR] \[tno]x3) \[AN] (\[tno]x1)
\[AN] (x2 \[OR] x3) is satisfiable, that is, if there is an assignment
of True or False to the logical variables x1, x2 and x3 such that the
formula evaluates to True.
This was the first problem proved to be NP-complete, which means that
there is no known algorithm that can solve it with a running time that
scales polynomially with the problem size in a worst-case scenario.
Here we study random Boolean formulas with fixed number of variables N
and number of clauses M that are generated by choosing randomly the
variables that appear in each clause and negating them with probability
1/2.
We solve those formulas using a random-walk based, local search
algorithm known as WalkSAT.
We show that the WalkSAT can be used to study a remarkable property of
the ensemble of random Boolean formulas \[en] there is a critical value
of the clauses-to-variables ratio M/N that separates satisfiable from
unsatisfiable formulas in the limit of large N \[en] and we characterize
the critical region, or the sharpness of the transition, for finite N
using finite-size scaling.
From the perspective of computer science, this transition is important
because satisfiable random formulas with the ratio M/N near the
transition point are hard to solve, in the sense that WalkSAT requires
much more time to find their solutions than in the case that ratio is
far from the critical region.
We show that a collective search strategy where several WalkSATs run in
parallel and halt when one of them finds the solution results in a
sub-linear speedup, that is, the speedup is less than the number of
WalkSATs used in the collective search.

.SS Open data provenance and reproducibility: a case study from publishing CMS open data, Nov 2020
.PP
In this paper we present the latest CMS open data release published on
the CERN Oopen Data portal.
Samples of collision and simulated datasets were released together with
detailed information about the data provenance.
The associated data production chains cover the necessary computing
environments, the configuration files and the computational procedures
used in each data production step.
We describe data curation techniques used to obtain and publish the data
provenance information and we study the possibility of reproducing parts
of the released data using the publicly available information.
The present work demonstrates the usefulness of releasing selected
samples of raw and primary data in order to fully ensure the
completeness of information about the data production chain for the
attention of general data scientists and other non-specialists
interested in using particle physics data for education or research
purposes.
