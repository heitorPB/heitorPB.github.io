# Heitor's log

[My personal site](https://heitorpb.github.io) with my random stuff

Made from scratch with Jekyll, bootstrap and black magic :)
Colors and CSS based on
[Cover example](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/examples/cover/) and
[Monday template](https://github.com/artemsheludko/monday) (i didn't use this
yet).

Code highlight CSS is `monokay` from
[jekyll-pygments-themes](https://github.com/jwarby/jekyll-pygments-themes/)

Nice plugin for making life easier:
