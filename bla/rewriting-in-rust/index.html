            <p>So I decided to rewrite my website. Again. This time because the previous
version kind of died: I‚Äôm struggling to run Jekyll to build a new version and
some of the assets I used via a CDN moved to a new path. So I decided to
rewrite it. <del>In Rust of course, to follow the trend</del>.</p>
<h2 id="a-bit-of-history">A bit of history</h2>
<p>I‚Äôve been building websites for me since my childhood, a looooong time ago.
But, unfortunately, I did not keep the original files, nor even screenshots. I
also did not keep a log of them either. I‚Äôm not sure when I had my first
website online :/</p>
<p>I made my first website in Adobe Flash. Back in the 2000s that was what the
cool kids used. Of course there was an HTML file, but only to display the SWF.
I remember some rotating spheres in the right upper corner, simulating a 3D
effect. I also made some [bad] platform games to download. This was hosted for
free on some host/provider I don‚Äôt recall and I also had a childish <code>.go.there</code>
domain (yeah, I was a kid). And no HTTPS, this was ~two decades ago. I don‚Äôt
have an exact time in mind, but it was around \( 2006 \pm 1 \).</p>
<p>The second version was a combination of Flash <em>and</em> custom HTML. I remember
using Macromedia (!) Dreamweaver to make <em>multiple pages</em>. What a progress!
This time I used a different host, also for free. I have an e-mail from April
11th 2008 when I signed up for FreeWebs.com to host this version. It went live
on that date and lasted until the next iteration.</p>
<p>The third version was a Wordpress on Blogger/Blogspot. Also for free. Way less
cool stuff, like the animated rotating spheres from the first version. But this
time it was not static! It had an admin page, a content editor and people could
comment on my glorious posts. All of that made possible by Wordpress.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220720184059/https://heitorpb.github.io/">fourth
version</a>
went live on September 8th, 2018. I decided to fall back to a static website,
hosted for free on GitHub Pages. I built this version using
<a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>. All the HTML and CSS were hand made by me :)
This is the version I am retiring now and looked like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://heitorpb.github.io/bla/rewriting-in-rust/v4-home.png" title="Home%20page%20of%20my%20previous%20personal%20website." alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" /></p>
<h2 id="">The new version</h2>
<p>For my newer website, I wanted something that could last longer. I don‚Äôt want
to go through all the hassle of searching for a new tool or platform, migrating
all the pages, making sure images/links/formatting are correct, fixing links to
external resources, writing/modifying website themes to suit my taste, etc, all
over again.</p>
<p>I also want my pages to load fast, have as minimum of JavaScript as possible,
display correctly on most browsers and devices, be easy to add new content,
and, of course, look good.</p>
<p>With these requirements in mind, I decided to go with
<a href="https://getzola.org">Zola</a>: an open-source static website generator. Zola is
simple enough to set up, doesn‚Äôt suffer from feature creep, has an active forum
to ask for help, with an active and welcoming community, has many themes
published, is actively maintained, is super fast and is written in Rust ü¶Ä</p>
<p>Zola alone does not solve all my problems. I learned from my mistakes and past
experiences, so:</p>
<ul>
<li>I wrote how to get Zola, the version I am using and the commands to
update/add/publish new content. Of course, most steps are in a script that I
run. I am too lazy to type stuff all the time.</li>
<li>As with the previous version, I generate my own HTMLs and keep them in a
repository that I control. I could use a CI/CD system here, for the sake of
‚Äúautomation‚Äù. But I prefer to run <code>zola build</code> myself, double check the
resulting HTML files and only then <code>git add &amp;&amp; git push</code>. This is not hard
and adds some peace of mind over mistakes.</li>
<li>Choose a theme that contains no external resources, pretty much all styling
is self contained. And no JavaScript!
<ul>
<li>I chose <a href="https://github.com/pawroman/zola-theme-terminimal">Terminimal</a>
theme. Not bare bones though, I made a few modifications here and there
to suit my taste.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I like equations and I am not aware of a way to use \( \LaTeX \) without
JavaScript. So I added <a href="https://katex.org">KaTeX</a> to render my precious
maths. Having <em>some</em> JavaScript because it is useful, not because it is a
trending buzzword in some online social network, doesn‚Äôt hurt (much).</li>
</ul>
<p>All of that is good. But Zola, like any tool, is not perfect. I had a few
challenges with the migration from Jekyll to Zola:</p>
<ul>
<li>Zola does not support abbreviations via Markdown/CommonMark. I‚Äôm talking
about the <code>abbr</code> HTML tag that looks like
<abbr title="Hello, this is an abbreviation in HTML world">this</abbr> (hover
your mouse there). I like this functionality, but I had to replace all the
markup I had with HTML tags in my files. Annoying, but doable.</li>
<li>Footnotes work, but are a bit rudimentary: I need to manually create the list
with footnotes and the anchor links do not work. Not sure if this is an issue
with the theme I chose or with Zola itself.</li>
<li>Zola‚Äôs internal sorting algorithm is case sensitive. This can be annoying in
some cases. One of them is to sort my tags: <code>C++</code> comes before <code>analysis</code> for
example, when it should be the opposite.</li>
<li>No lazy loading of images. Again, not a critical issue, but lazy loading
images can benefit loading pages on limited internet connections. There might
be downsides from lazy loading, but I am not aware of them. There‚Äôs an open
feature request at the time of writing, so it is a question of time until
this arrives :)</li>
</ul>
<p>Apart from these hiccups, ‚Äúconverting‚Äù my website from Jekyll to Zola was
straightforward. After all, it‚Äôs all Markdown files.</p>
<h2 id="-1">The future</h2>
<p>What‚Äôs next? I have a new website, what do I do with it?</p>
<p>Something ancient on my TODO list is to get a nice domain name. I‚Äôm not
creative enough to think of one and my interactions with chatGPT were
‚Äúinconclusive‚Äù. Having yet another new website can be an excuse to finally get
my own domain?</p>
<p>I want to write more and publish what I write. I have been collecting notes for
a while and could turn some of those into interesting articles. I invested many
evenings into this rewrite, I can‚Äôt let this new website collect dust.</p>
<p>I also have many drafts of posts/articles I started and never finished. And I
have a <em>‚Äúlist of ideas to blag about‚Äù</em> that only grows. Some of those items
<em>should</em> materialize.</p>
<p>Maybe I will write something soon‚Ñ¢Ô∏è. Or make a new website. What will happen
first?</p>
