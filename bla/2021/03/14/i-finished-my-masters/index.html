		<p>Over the last years, I studied, traveled, worked hard, and I finally got the title of Master of Science in Physics!</p>

<p>It was not easy. I started in the field of radio-frequency electronics for
Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy. The goal was to build a local
oscillator module from which to synchronize the entire machine: FPGA‚Äôs clock,
AD/DA clocks, mixers reference, and all other clock sources. Ideally, this
would reduce the overall phase noise of the machine. I had some preliminary
results that were pretty awesome <img draggable="false" title=":sunglasses:" alt="üòé" src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/svg/1f60e.svg" class="emoji" /> I used a 10 MHz OCXO to make any
frequency up to a few GHz. This was low power (about ~10 dBm), but enough to
add noises to many labs in the building. I spent months trying to find a
passive filter topology that could get rid of signals 10 MHz away from a center
frequency, with an isolation of at least 100 dB. The result was better than I
expected: we even considered using it as the external reference for the lab‚Äôs
oscilloscopes, spectrum analyzer, and network analyzer.</p>

<p><img src="clock-boards.jpg" alt="" title="A horrible photo showing four of the five components of the system, connected to a spectrum analyzer and an oscilloscope. I also made a 1:16 power splitter, not in the photo." /></p>

<p>I then spent six awesome months at <a href="https://home.cern">CERN</a>, working with the
<a href="https://opendata.cern.ch/">OpenData</a> team! This was totally unexpected, and
mind-blowing. CERN is huge. Way bigger than I thought. And everything in there
happens at extreme scales. My task was to mine ‚Äúsome‚Äù datasets and discover
<em>how</em> they were generated. For each dataset, I had to query some systems, read
some files, and write down what were the parameters used to create that
dataset. The only detail that made all that out of the ordinary is the scale:
we are talking about several hundreds of terabytes of data. As of now, there
are about 2500 terabytes (2.5 petabytes) available for public use, and more to
come. This is not something you can parse quickly, and definitely something
you need to be extra careful when reading/analyzing/downloading.</p>

<p>Then I came back to Brazil, to continue my studies. I still needed to take some
courses to have all the credits needed to finish my Master. About half a year
later I started working as a Python developer at a local company.</p>

<p>And I needed to write my Thesis! For reasons, I started out fresh. New research
topic, new supervisor, new tools, new plans. Full time job and full time
research.</p>

<p>To complicate even more everything: we had the Covid-19 pandemic. And it hit
hard. At work, the company needed to adapt, restructure, and we went full
remote. At the University, the classes were interrupted, laboratories closed,
and eventually the classes restarted online and labs reopened with many
restrictions. My research topic did not require any presence at the University:
I could study and develop my simulations at home, and run them remotely at the
University‚Äôs computers. But still, I felt the impact of the restrictions.</p>

<p>I managed to adapt, evolve, and handle life-work-studies in a way that in 2021
I started a new job, as a Senior Python Engineer, and defended my Master‚Äôs
Thesis: <code class="highlighter-rouge">Search strategies and phase transition in the Random Boolean
satisfiability problem</code>! In which I used some tools from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_physics">Statistical
Physics</a> to analyze an
NP-Complete problem.</p>

<p><img src="defense-phase-transition.jpeg" alt="" title="The Phase Transition of Random Boolean formulas. One of the main points of my thesis was to reproduce this famous result using a different technique. Thanks to my uncle for screenshotting my presentation!" /></p>

<p>Now, looking back, I see those years as an epic journey: I visited two
continents, I met and interacted with people from all over the world, I learned
a lot about so many things in diverse topics, I had hands-on experience in
diverse areas. It was a period of immense professional and personal growth.</p>

<p>But I did not do it all alone. I had great people by my side, supporting me,
encouraging me, proud of me. My family always invested in my education, since
my childhood, and supported me in every way they could. My girlfriend, my
friends, and colleagues, were always there with their friendship, company,
last-minute ideas for barbecues and burghers.</p>

<p>And last but not least, my supervisor. He was always available to answer all my
questions, and he was very good at explaining everything I asked. Sometimes his
answer was not what I wanted, but a way for me to think and analyze the
situation and answer the question myself. His enthusiasm, patience, and
charisma were essential to make this work happen.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>
