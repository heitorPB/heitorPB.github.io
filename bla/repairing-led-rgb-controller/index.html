        <div class="post-content">
            <p>We have a remote controlled LED lighting in our living room. It is an LED strip
glued under the sofa, with a small controller box and a remote control to turn
it on/off and control the colors. These effects make our living room cozier and
the visits impressed :)</p>
<p>But a couple of days ago the remote controller stopped working: no more turning
on or off, changing colors or effects. The battery was relatively new and with
enough juice to make the control work.</p>
<p>So I started poking at the electronic box. This is the box:</p>

  <figure class="center" >
    <img src="controller-box.jpg" alt="LED controller box" style="width: 80%" />
    
      <figcaption class="center"><p>The LED controller box has a power connector (not seen), an
IR sensor (the black square on the end of the white cable)
and the LED output power (the colored cable).</p>
</figcaption>
    
  </figure>

<p>Opening the box was harder than I thought. The lid has one of those locking
mechanisms that are not accessible from the outside. A small screwdriver did
the job and almost broke it. With the lid open, I can remove and inspect the
circuit board.</p>
<p>The circuit is quite simple: three transistors, each one driving each LED
color, an unnamed microcontroller, an infrared sensor and a power connector. I
wonder what microcontroller is that, an ATtiny maybe?</p>
<p>The PCB seemed fine to me. I thought the cats would have pulled the sensor and
I‚Äôd need to resolder it to the PCB. But it didn‚Äôt seem to be the case. The
sensor, on the other hand, did not seem to be on its best days:</p>

  <figure class="center" >
    <img src="covered-sensor.jpg" alt="The IR sensor, connected to the cable and the electrical
               connection covered in plastic for electrical protection. The
               thermoplastic has many bite marks." style="width: 80%" />
    
      <figcaption class="center"><p>The IR sensor (black thingy), connected to the cable and the
electrical connection covered in thermoplastic for
protection.</p>
</figcaption>
    
  </figure>

<p>There are many marks in the thermoplastic that covers the sensor connection.
Yeah, the cat ate the sensor. Or at least took a few bites. After removing that
weird white cover, the issue appears:</p>

  <figure class="center" >
    <img src="broken-solder.jpg" alt="The IR sensor after removing the thermoplastic, we can see the
               IR sensor has three connections, but only two are soldered. The
               middle connection was bitten away." style="width: 80%" />
    
      <figcaption class="center"><p>After removing the thermoplastic, we can see the IR sensor
has three connections, but only two are soldered. The middle
connection was bitten away.</p>
</figcaption>
    
  </figure>

<p>One of the solders was broken. Hopefully the sensor still works and the problem
is that broken solder. Well, I have some [rudimentary] soldering skills and a
soldering iron, re-soldering was quick. Time to close it and put back into its
place to test:</p>

  <figure class="center" >
    <img src="production-ready.jpg" alt="LED controller glued under the sofa, connected to power and
               LEDs, with repaired IR sensor visible." style="width: 80%" />
    
      <figcaption class="center"><p>LED controller deployed <del>to production</del> under the sofa,
connected to power and the repaired IR sensor glued for
cat-proofing, maybe.</p>
</figcaption>
    
  </figure>

<p>Now that everything is in place, it should work, right?</p>

<p>It works! üéâ What a crappy video‚Ä¶</p>
