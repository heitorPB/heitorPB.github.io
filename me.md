Preservation and Open Access.

During his free time, he is a co-organizer of technological groups of São
Carlos city: [grupy-sanca](https://www.grupysanca.com.br),

[sanca hackerspace](https://sancahs.grupysanca.com.br).

His CV can be found, partially, in

He has a passion for photography and pretends he knows something about it. He
enjoys walking around cities and mountains and forests to take pictures. Most
of them are not published anywhere but some are in his Facebook.

Heitor is also a music enthusiast. From the sweetness of Tchaikovsky's ballets, to
the nastiness of Sepultura and also the uniqueness of Heilung's experiments. He
appreciates a composer that can use the contrast of these styles in the same
song.
