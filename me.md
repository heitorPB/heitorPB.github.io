His CV can be found, partially, in
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/heitorpb/) and in

During his free time, he is a co-organizer of technological groups of São
Carlos city: [grupy-sanca](https://www.grupysanca.com.br),

He has a passion for photography and pretends he knows something about it. He
enjoys walking around cities and mountains and forests to take pictures.

Heitor is a music enthusiast. From the sweetness of Tchaikovsky's ballets, to
the nastiness of Sepultura and also the uniqueness of Heilung's experiments. He
appreciates a composer that can use the contrast of these styles in the same
song.

Feel free to get in touch :) He'll try to answer you "shortly"!
